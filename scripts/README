# Analysis to compare frequency of kmers on samples/ref

Extract kmers with FastK. Requires using a named temp
folder as HPC limits the size of the default one.

Set all fa files on the current folder (TO UPDATE TO NAMED FOLDER)

Check the unique kmers frequency distribution of a set of genomes:
```
for f in *.fa; do sbatch -c 8 -t 08:00:00 ukmers_check.sh -i $f; done
```
We will use k=17 as as the smaller k with significant information.
Now we calculate the jaccard distance between each pair of genomes.

```
./pairwise_slurm.sh .
```
With exit file and kmer size
```
scripts/pairwise_slurm.sh assemblies 21 results/15_genomes_k21
```

To check: use as distance the difference in frequencies of each kmer. This 
might normalize for size while still counting for duplication events.

Steps:

1- Set up all the genomes in one folder (must be .fa.gz or .fasta.gz)
2- Use kmers_batch_generator to generate the "all" files
3- Use pairwise_slurm to obtain distances. Can be used incrementally with new genomes.
4- Use dendograms.R to generate dendograms with the distances.
