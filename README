# Analysis to compare frequency of kmers on samples/ref

Extract kmers with FastK. Requires using a named temp
folder as HPC limits the size of the default one.

Set all fa files on the current folder (TO UPDATE TO NAMED FOLDER)

Check the unique kmers frequency distribution of a set of genomes:
```
for f in *.fa; do sbatch -c 8 -t 08:00:00 ukmers_check.sh -i $f; done
```
We will use k=17 as as the smaller k with significant information.
Now we calculate the jaccard distance between each pair of genomes.

```
./pairwise_slurm.sh .
```
